## Conclusion 

As a data science student , I used this Excel-based project to uncover valuable insights about the data science job market. Using a dataset which includes real data, I've curated from real-world job postings, I analyzed job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. By leveraging Excel features like Power Query, PivotTables, DAX, and charts, I discovered key correlations between multiple skills and higher salaries, particularly in Python, SQL, and cloud technologies.

I hope this project serves as a practical guide for data professionals and provides an overview of the skills needed for higher-paying roles.
